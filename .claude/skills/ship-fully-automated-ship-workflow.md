## AskUserQuestion Format

**ALWAYS follow this structure for every AskUserQuestion call:**
1. **Re-ground:** State the project, the current branch, and the current plan/task. (1-2 sentences)
2. **Simplify:** Explain the problem in plain English a smart 16-year-old could follow.
3. **Recommend:** `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]`
4. **Options:** Lettered options: `A) ... B) ... C) ...`

Assume the user hasn't looked at this window in 20 minutes and doesn't have the code open.

## Step 0: Detect base branch

Determine which branch this PR targets. Use the result as "the base branch" in all subsequent steps.

1. Check if a PR already exists for this branch:
   `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`
   If this succeeds, use the printed branch name as the base branch.

2. If no PR exists (command fails), detect the repo's default branch:
   `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`

3. If both commands fail, fall back to `main`.

Print the detected base branch name.

# Ship: Fully Automated Ship Workflow

You are running the `/ship` workflow. This is a **non-interactive, fully automated** workflow. Do NOT ask for confirmation at any step. The user said `/ship` which means DO IT. Run straight through and output the PR URL at the end.

**Only stop for:**
- On the base branch (abort)
- Merge conflicts that can't be auto-resolved (stop, show conflicts)
- Test failures (stop, show failures)
- Pre-landing review finds ASK items that need user judgment
- MINOR or MAJOR version bump needed (ask — see Step 4)
- TODOS.md missing and user wants to create one (ask — see Step 5.5)
- TODOS.md disorganized and user wants to reorganize (ask — see Step 5.5)

**Never stop for:**
- Uncommitted changes (always include them)
- Version bump choice (auto-pick MICRO or PATCH — see Step 4)
- CHANGELOG content (auto-generate from diff)
- Commit message approval (auto-commit)
- Multi-file changesets (auto-split into bisectable commits)
- TODOS.md completed-item detection (auto-mark)
- Auto-fixable review findings (dead code, N+1, stale comments — fixed automatically)

---

## Step 1: Pre-flight

1. Check the current branch. If on the base branch or the repo's default branch, **abort**: "You're on the base branch. Ship from a feature branch."

2. Run `git status` (never use `-uall`). Uncommitted changes are always included — no need to ask.

3. Run `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` and `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to understand what's being shipped.

---

## Step 2: Merge the base branch (BEFORE tests)

Fetch and merge the base branch into the feature branch so tests run against the merged state:

```bash
git fetch origin <base> && git merge origin/<base> --no-edit
```

**If there are merge conflicts:** Try to auto-resolve if they are simple (VERSION, schema.rb, CHANGELOG ordering). If conflicts are complex or ambiguous, **STOP** and show them.

**If already up to date:** Continue silently.

---

## Step 3: Run tests (on merged code)

**Auto-detect the test runner:**

1. If `package.json` exists and has a `"test"` script → `npm test` (or `pnpm test` if pnpm-lock.yaml exists, or `yarn test` if yarn.lock exists)
2. If `Makefile` exists and has a `test` target → `make test`
3. If `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pytest]`, or `setup.cfg` with `[tool:pytest]` → `pytest`
4. If `Gemfile` exists → `bundle exec rake test` (or `bundle exec rspec` if `.rspec` exists)
5. If `Cargo.toml` exists → `cargo test`
6. If `go.mod` exists → `go test ./...`
7. If none detected → AskUserQuestion: "I couldn't detect a test runner. What command should I run?"

Run the detected test command(s). If multiple test runners are detected (e.g., both Rails and JS), run them in parallel.

**If any test fails:** Show the failures and **STOP**. Do not proceed.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — just note the counts briefly.

---

## Step 3.5: Pre-Landing Review

Review the diff for structural issues that tests don't catch.

1. Read `.claude/skills/review/checklist.md`. If the file cannot be read, **STOP** and report the error.

2. Run `git diff origin/<base>` to get the full diff (scoped to feature changes against the freshly-fetched base branch).

3. Apply the review checklist in two passes:
   - **Pass 1 (CRITICAL):** SQL & Data Safety, LLM Output Trust Boundary
   - **Pass 2 (INFORMATIONAL):** All remaining categories

4. **Classify each finding as AUTO-FIX or ASK** per the Fix-First Heuristic in
   checklist.md. Critical findings lean toward ASK; informational lean toward AUTO-FIX.

5. **Auto-fix all AUTO-FIX items.** Apply each fix. Output one line per fix:
   `[AUTO-FIXED] [file:line] Problem → what you did`

6. **If ASK items remain,** present them in ONE AskUserQuestion:
   - List each with number, severity, problem, recommended fix
   - Per-item options: A) Fix  B) Skip
   - Overall RECOMMENDATION
   - If 3 or fewer ASK items, you may use individual AskUserQuestion calls instead

7. **After all fixes (auto + user-approved):**
   - If ANY fixes were applied: commit fixed files by name (`git add <fixed-files> && git commit -m "fix: pre-landing review fixes"`), then **STOP** and tell the user to run `/ship` again to re-test.
   - If no fixes applied (all ASK items skipped, or no issues found): continue to Step 4.

8. Output summary: `Pre-Landing Review: N issues — M auto-fixed, K asked (J fixed, L skipped)`

   If no issues found: `Pre-Landing Review: No issues found.`

Save the review output — it goes into the PR body in Step 8.

---

## Step 4: Version bump (auto-decide)

1. Read the current `VERSION` file (if it exists). Support common formats: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` (4-digit), `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (semver).

2. **If no VERSION file exists:** Skip this step silently.

3. **Auto-decide the bump level based on the diff:**
   - Count lines changed (`git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --stat | tail -1`)
   - **MICRO/PATCH** (smallest digit): < 50 lines changed, trivial tweaks, typos, config
   - **PATCH/MINOR** (next digit): 50+ lines changed, bug fixes, small-medium features
   - **MINOR/MAJOR** (next digit): **ASK the user** — only for major features or significant architectural changes
   - **MAJOR** (1st digit): **ASK the user** — only for milestones or breaking changes

4. Compute the new version:
   - Bumping a digit resets all digits to its right to 0

5. Write the new version to the `VERSION` file.

---

## Step 5: CHANGELOG (auto-generate)

1. Read `CHANGELOG.md` header to know the format. If no CHANGELOG.md exists, create one.

2. Auto-generate the entry from **ALL commits on the branch** (not just recent ones):
   - Use `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` to see every commit being shipped
   - Use `git diff <base>...HEAD` to see the full diff against the base branch
   - The CHANGELOG entry must be comprehensive of ALL changes going into the PR
   - If existing CHANGELOG entries on the branch already cover some commits, replace them with one unified entry for the new version
   - Categorize changes into applicable sections:
     - `### Added` — new features
     - `### Changed` — changes to existing functionality
     - `### Fixed` — bug fixes
     - `### Removed` — removed features
   - Write concise, descriptive bullet points
   - Insert after the file header, dated today
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z.W] - YYYY-MM-DD` (or `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` for semver)

**Do NOT ask the user to describe changes.** Infer from the diff and commit history.

---

## Step 5.5: TODOS.md (auto-update)

Cross-reference the project's TODOS.md against the changes being shipped. Mark completed items automatically; prompt only if the file is missing or disorganized.

**1. Check if TODOS.md exists** in the repository root.

**If TODOS.md does not exist:** Use AskUserQuestion:
- Message: "It's recommended to maintain a TODOS.md organized by component, then priority. Would you like to create one?"
- Options: A) Create it now, B) Skip for now
- If A: Create `TODOS.md` with a skeleton (# TODOS heading + ## Completed section). Continue to step 3.
- If B: Skip the rest of Step 5.5. Continue to Step 6.

**2. Check structure and organization:**

Read TODOS.md and verify it follows a reasonable structure:
- Items grouped under headings
- Each item has some priority indication
- A Completed section at the bottom

**If disorganized** (no groupings, no Completed section): Use AskUserQuestion:
- Message: "TODOS.md doesn't follow a recommended structure (component groupings, priority, Completed section). Would you like to reorganize it?"
- Options: A) Reorganize now (recommended), B) Leave as-is
- If A: Reorganize in-place. Preserve all content — only restructure, never delete items.
- If B: Continue to step 3 without restructuring.

**3. Detect completed TODOs:**

This step is fully automatic — no user interaction.

Use the diff and commit history already gathered in earlier steps:
- `git diff <base>...HEAD` (full diff against the base branch)
- `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` (all commits being shipped)

For each TODO item, check if the changes in this PR complete it by:
- Matching commit messages against the TODO title and description
- Checking if files referenced in the TODO appear in the diff
- Checking if the TODO's described work matches the functional changes

**Be conservative:** Only mark a TODO as completed if there is clear evidence in the diff. If uncertain, leave it alone.

**4. Move completed items** to the `## Completed` section at the bottom. Append: `**Completed:** vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)`

**5. Output summary:**
- `TODOS.md: N items marked complete (item1, item2, ...). M items remaining.`
- Or: `TODOS.md: No completed items detected. M items remaining.`
- Or: `TODOS.md: Created.` / `TODOS.md: Reorganized.`

**6. Defensive:** If TODOS.md cannot be written (permission error, disk full), warn the user and continue. Never stop the ship workflow for a TODOS failure.

Save this summary — it goes into the PR body in Step 8.

---

## Step 6: Commit (bisectable chunks)

**Goal:** Create small, logical commits that work well with `git bisect` and help LLMs understand what changed.

1. Analyze the diff and group changes into logical commits. Each commit should represent **one coherent change** — not one file, but one logical unit.

2. **Commit ordering** (earlier commits first):
   - **Infrastructure:** migrations, config changes, route additions
   - **Models & services:** new models, services, concerns (with their tests)
   - **Controllers & views:** controllers, views, JS/React components (with their tests)
   - **VERSION + CHANGELOG + TODOS.md:** always in the final commit

3. **Rules for splitting:**
   - A model and its test file go in the same commit
   - A service and its test file go in the same commit
   - A controller, its views, and its test go in the same commit
   - Migrations are their own commit (or grouped with the model they support)
   - Config/route changes can group with the feature they enable
   - If the total diff is small (< 50 lines across < 4 files), a single commit is fine

4. **Each commit must be independently valid** — no broken imports, no references to code that doesn't exist yet. Order commits so dependencies come first.

5. Compose each commit message:
   - First line: `<type>: <summary>` (type = feat/fix/chore/refactor/docs)
   - Body: brief description of what this commit contains
   - Only the **final commit** (VERSION + CHANGELOG) gets the co-author trailer:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore: bump version and changelog (vX.Y.Z.W)

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

---

## Step 7: Push

Push to the remote with upstream tracking:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

---

## Step 8: Create PR

Create a pull request using `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --base <base> --title "<type>: <summary>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<bullet points from CHANGELOG>

## Pre-Landing Review
<findings from Step 3.5, or "No issues found.">

## TODOS
<If items marked complete: bullet list of completed items with version>
<If no items completed: "No TODO items completed in this PR.">
<If TODOS.md created or reorganized: note that>
<If TODOS.md doesn't exist and user skipped: omit this section>

## Test plan
- [x] All tests pass

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

)"
```

**Output the PR URL** — this should be the final output the user sees.

---

## Important Rules

- **Never skip tests.** If tests fail, stop.
- **Never skip the pre-landing review.** If checklist.md is unreadable, stop.
- **Never force push.** Use regular `git push` only.
- **Never ask for confirmation** except for MINOR/MAJOR version bumps and pre-landing review ASK items.
- **Always use the version format** from the VERSION file.
- **Date format in CHANGELOG:** `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **Split commits for bisectability** — each commit = one logical change.
- **TODOS.md completion detection must be conservative.**
- **The goal is: user says `/ship`, next thing they see is the review + PR URL.**
